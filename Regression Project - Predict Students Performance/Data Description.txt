The Student Performance Dataset is a meticulously curated dataset tailored to investigate the determinants influencing academic student performance. Comprising 10,000 individual student records, each entry within this dataset encapsulates multifaceted information concerning various predictor variables alongside a performance index.

The dataset encompasses the following variables:

1. Hours Studied: Denoting the aggregate number of hours allocated by each student towards academic study.
2. Previous Scores: Reflecting the scores attained by students in antecedent examinations.
3. Extracurricular Activities: Signifying the involvement of students in supplementary educational pursuits, categorized as either affirmative (Yes) or negative (No).
4. Sleep Hours: Indicating the average duration of nightly rest obtained by the student populace.
5. Sample Question Papers Practiced: Quantifying the quantity of sample question papers assimilated by each student as a preparatory measure.

The focal target variable within this dataset is the Performance Index. This index serves as a composite metric delineating the comprehensive academic achievement of each student. Notably, the Performance Index values are discretely rounded to the nearest integer and range from 10 to 100, with higher numerical values indicative of superior academic performance.

The overarching objective of this dataset is to furnish a comprehensive platform for elucidating the interrelationships between the aforementioned predictor variables and the resultant performance index. Researchers and data analysts can leverage this dataset to conduct nuanced explorations into the nuanced impacts of studying hours, previous scores, engagement in extracurricular activities, sleep patterns, and engagement with sample question papers on student performance.

It is imperative to acknowledge that while this dataset is synthetic in nature and contrived for illustrative intents, the depicted associations between the variables and the performance index may not be indicative of real-world scenarios.
