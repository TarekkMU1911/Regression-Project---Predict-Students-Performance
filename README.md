# Regression-Project---Predict-Students-Performance
This project assesses linear and polynomial regression models' efficacy in predicting student performance. Both models demonstrate high accuracy, with polynomial regression capturing nonlinearities. However, caution is needed to prevent overfitting and manage computational complexity, highlighting their utility in academic forecasting.
